## 📌 Solution Approach  

Efficient task management is crucial for productivity, yet manual task allocation is often inefficient, biased, and time-consuming. Our AI Task Allocation System aims to solve this by introducing **intelligent, automated task assignment** using AI-driven decision-making.  

### **Thought Process Behind the Solution**  
1. **Identifying the Problem:**  
   - In many organizations, tasks are assigned manually, leading to **inefficiencies, workload imbalances, and human bias**.  
   - A **data-driven, AI-powered** approach can **objectively** match tasks to the best-suited individuals.  

2. **Defining Key Requirements:**  
   - The system should be **lightweight and easy to integrate**, so we opted for **CSV files** as the initial data source.  
   - It should be **scalable**, allowing future enhancements like **database integration or advanced AI models**.  

3. **Designing the Allocation Strategy:**  
   - AI models (OpenAI/Gemini) analyze **task descriptions and priority levels** to determine required skills.  
   - The system **cross-references** tasks with user skill sets and past assignments to find the most suitable candidate.  
   - The **allocation algorithm considers workload balancing**, ensuring fair task distribution.  

4. **Ensuring Usability & Real-Time Updates:**  
   - A **FastAPI backend** processes tasks and user data efficiently.  
   - A **React frontend** provides a **clear, interactive interface** for viewing task assignments in real-time.  
   - AI-driven decisions are **transparent** and can be manually adjusted if needed.  

### **Why This Approach?**  
✅ **Eliminates Human Bias** – AI assigns tasks based on skill matching rather than subjective judgment.  
✅ **Saves Time & Effort** – Automates the tedious process of task allocation.  
✅ **Optimizes Productivity** – Ensures that the right person gets the right task at the right time.  

This approach provides a **scalable, intelligent task management system** that significantly enhances efficiency while being adaptable to future improvements. 🚀

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

To build the AI Task Allocation system, we used:

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) – for handling API requests and managing task/user data.
- **Frontend:** React with Chakra UI – for an intuitive user interface.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API / Gemini API – for intelligent task allocation.
- **Storage:** CSV files – for lightweight, Excel-compatible data storage.

The system is designed for **scalability**, allowing easy integration with databases and advanced AI models.

## ⚡ Execution Steps

To run the system, follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/ai-task-allocation.git
cd ai-task-allocation
```

### 2️⃣ Set Up Backend (FastAPI)
```sh
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
📍 The backend runs at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

### 3️⃣ Set Up Frontend (React)
```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
📍 The frontend runs at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
